# DHT (Distributed Hash Table) library

## Description

This project is a Java implementation of a Distributed Hash Table, encapsulating its three main implementations - Chord, Pastry and Kademlia. It uses gRPC for communication between nodes and Maven for dependency management.

A distributed hash table (DHT) is a distributed system that provides a lookup service similar to a hash table. Keyâ€“value pairs are stored in a DHT, and any participating node can efficiently retrieve the value associated with a given key. The main advantage of a DHT is that nodes can be added or removed with minimum work around re-distributing keys.
